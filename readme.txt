ASSUMPTIONS
1. You can book a leave for a date before current date (For example if you were sick and therefore went oon leave without booking leave)



LEAVE DAYS REMAINING
On your dashboard you can view two values for leave days remaining.
1. The current leave days you have before you take the planned leave not yet taken
2. the leave days you have left after taking all planned/requested leave
